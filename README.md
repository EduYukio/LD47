# Tower of Madness
My Ludum Dare 47 Compo Entry.

A challenging platform game, inspired by *Celeste* and *I Wanna be the Guy*. It has 30 small levels: about 15 minutes of gameplay.

In this game, you control a young boy who is bored of his repetitive routine. One day, he finds a small, simple-looking tower. Seeking for adventure, he hops right into it, ending up stuck in a mad loop!

Do you have what it takes to break out of the **Tower of Madness**?
